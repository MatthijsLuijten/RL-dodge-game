## 💡 Idea

Train a Reinforcement Learning agent to play a simple dodging game. The game consists of a top-view grid, where the agent can move up, down, left or right. Enemies enter from each side and will cross the field. The agent will die when it is touched by one of the enemies. The amount of time the agent stays alive is equal to the score (reward) of the agent.
